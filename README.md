#DXCache Cleaner

DXCache Cleaner is a lightweight, open‑source utility that automatically removes NVIDIA DXCache (shader cache) on a custom schedule. Shader cache can accumulate over time and cause conflicts, leading to sudden FPS drops in games. This app runs silently in the background — no command windows, no interruptions.

#Key Features

+User Interface (UI): Simple Tkinter GUI with buttons, sliders, and log display.

+Task Management: Create, delete, and check scheduled tasks via Windows Task Scheduler.

+Cache Cleaning: Generates hidden PowerShell + VBScript files to remove DXCache and log results.

+Logging: Temporary log file (dxcache_log.txt) stored in %TEMP%, auto‑deleted after 100 seconds.

+Silent Execution: Tasks run completely hidden, without CMD/PowerShell windows popping up.

#Workflow

+User selects a schedule in the GUI.

+App checks for admin rights.

+Generates .ps1 and .vbs scripts.

+Registers a hidden task in Windows Task Scheduler.

+Task runs silently → deletes DXCache → writes log → auto‑cleans log after 100s.

+Options available: Test Now, View Log, Delete Task.
